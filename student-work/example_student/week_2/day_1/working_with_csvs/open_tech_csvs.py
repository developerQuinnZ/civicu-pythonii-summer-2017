# to use the csvs in the class's shared-resoruces directory you'll need to
# either reference them by uning a relative path
# Ex. "../../../../../shared-resources/<csv_file_name>.csv"
# or if you prefer you can make a copy and move the files into this directory
# just please try to remember not to commit the csv files when you're saving 
# your work.
